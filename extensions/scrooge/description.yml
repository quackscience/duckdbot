    Scrooge McDuck is a third-party financial extension for DuckDB. 
    This extension's main goal is to support a set of aggregation functions and data scanners for financial data. 
    It currently supports access to the logs of Ethereum nodes and stock information from Yahoo Finance.
    More information on the supported scanners and functions can be found on Scrooge's [wiki page](https://github.com/pdet/Scrooge-McDuck/wiki).
